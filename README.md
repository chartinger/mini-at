# Minimalistic esp AT firmware

This is minimalistic AT firmware supporting only a small subset of the official one (https://github.com/espressif/esp-at)

### But why?

I needed a simple method to enable websocket connections to a DCC-EX CommandStationEx (https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX) (https://dcc-ex.com/)

Given i already did a bridge version, it seemed the perfect opportunity to take a deeper dive into AT commands.
